# Mazen Cinematic v2 – Remade (Accurate)

This package keeps the original v2 content/layout and adds:
- Rich Lottie motion (scroll-driven cup, theme toggle animation, section/ambient accents)
- Working Dark/Light toggle with persistence (localStorage)
- Meeting booking buttons aligned (15/30 min)
- No Three.js dependency for the hero center object (removed)
